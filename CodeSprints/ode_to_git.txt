Oh git!
you may confuse me now,
but later you will make me less confused,
I think...


I fear that I will run out of time
I'm typing so I don't get left behind

every hill I climb
I find two more on the other side.

Any present suffering,
will just mean a future ease!

Just checking fr today, if I can still do this! 


Co-coding a poem would be so fun,
But if it fails I will impress no one.

When I look at a blank sheet
and think about git
my mind becomes a blank
and I need to git merge with my
upstream thoughts

One two three four five
Follow the steps
of the GIT cookbook
and make your fussy cake
